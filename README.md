# DANA 4840 Group Project

## Clustering Analysis Project

### Overview

This repository contains the materials for the [DANA 4840 project](DANA%204840%20Project%20Details.pdf), which involves
performing clustering analyses using
different clustering methods (k-means, PAM, and hierarchical agglomerative clustering) on two different datasets. The
project aims to explore the clustering tendency of datasets, determine the optimal number of clusters, validate
clusters, and answer two research questions related to clustering.

### Project Components

#### Clustering Analyses

- Methods:
    - Partitioning Clustering: k-means, PAM
    - Hierarchical Clustering: various linkage methods
- Datasets:
    - One dataset for partitioning clustering (minimum 150 observations)
    - One dataset for hierarchical clustering
- Goals:
    - Assess clustering tendency
    - Determine the optimal number of clusters
    - Validate clusters
    - Compare results of different clustering methods

#### Research Component

- Questions: Two research questions related to clustering beyond class discussions
- Purpose: Explore and explain advanced clustering topics

### Research Questions

- Question 1: What is the role of dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g. PCA, t-SNE) in enhancing clustering
  performance, and how do they compare?
- Question 2: How can we identify and imterpret similarities in features within clustering results to enhance the
  understanding of cluster formation and structure?
